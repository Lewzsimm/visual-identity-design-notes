## What is a Visual Identity?

A Visual Identity consists of all of the visual elements of a Brand

> ### So what is a brand?<br>A brand encompasses everything that can affect how people perceive a company, from:<br>*Logo design<br>* Audio and Jingles<br>*Spokespeople<br>* Staff<br>To anything else that the company does which can be seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled, or otherwise perceived by the public, and the potential customer<br>

<br>

> Our job when designing an Identity is to design a *Brand Logo*, as well as provide the *full Visual Identity*

The visual identity of a Brand consists of:

* The use of colors

* Logo design

* Website design

* Print and stationary design

And everything else that requires any sort of visual asset used by the Brand

> **When you are providing a Visual Identity, you don't just design a logo, you are providing clients with a *full visual identity***

## Color

This goes beyond what looks good, we must consider the **objectives** of the brand as well as **color psychology**

Undrstanding color psychology is crucial when designing an identity, as colors elicit certain emotional responses which people will then associate with the brand

### Basics of color psychology

These feelings are dual edged, and depend on context. For example, if the word "Exciting" is in Red-Cursive text, it has a romantic feeling; however that same word in Yellow-Bold conveys a Thrilling-energy instead.

Here are the basics of the positive and negative aspects of common colors:

* Black

Prestige, power, authority - fear or uncertainty

* White

Positive, pure, safe - void, plain, air

* Red

Passion, happiness - violence, anger, heat, fire, "stop"

* Blue

Confidence, intelligence, stability, calmness - sadness, cold, water (light/mixed with white = air to us earthlings)

* Yellow

Happiness, vibrance, energetic - "caution", sickness, sour

* Green

Nature, energy, wealth, earth/life/biological, nutritional, "go" - greed/avarice, sickness/germs, radioactive

* Orange (Red and Yellow combined)

Joy, happiness, positivity, vitality - caution/warning, gluttony, generic, waning(like the setting sun)

* Pink

Personable, friendly, approachable, childhood, sweet/dessert, romantic, feminine - noisey/odd, attention-seeking, weakness

* Brown

Nature, organics, honesty/based, connected, calmness - dirt, hard, generic, old, plain

* Purple

Prestige, power, luxury, royalty, magic, fruity-berries/dessert - black magic, obnoxious, poisonous

> These are **Basics** and brushing up on color psychology should be the first step before beginning **any** visual identity design, because the world is run by feelings, and so are sales!

## Typography

Understanding Typography is very important when constructing a visual identity.

It is important to establish a preferred typeface selection that a company can use throughout their visual identity.
> The typeface that is used to display the business' name, or the logo, does not have to be, and most often is not; the same typeface that will be used throughout the rest of the visual identity

* Kerning

 Is the space between individual characters

* Tracking

 Is the space between words

* Leading

is the amount of vertical space between lines of text

### Fonts

* Serif

> Serif fonts are those whoch have letter embellishments, such as "feet" on the bottom of a capital letter A

Tradition, sophistication, establishment, luxury, elegant etc

* Sans-serif (no serif)

Modern, minimalistic, simplistic, to the point

## Brand/Corporate Identity Guidelines

This is an outline of several key component aspects as pertaining to a company's brand

* The objectives of the brand, and what the company is about

* The color palette to be used including it's codes in various formats (RGBA, HSL, HEX)

* The Type face selections, along with previews of the typeface

* The logo and it's various design iterations

Some identity guidelines will also provide specific instructions on how the identity may or may not be used, such as "H1 must always use font 1 for the first letter of the heading, and font 2 for the rest" for example; or "The logo may never appear in the colors red or pink under any circumstances, but all else are acceptable providing the underline is always Black, and it has a Margin of 3rem whenever placed in the corner of a page"

Many of the largest companies have identity guidelines in the neighborhood of 100 pages because they want absolute congruency across large numbers of people throughout various departments that are all working on content simultaneously

For this reason the smaller the team working on the products, the less guidelines will be required to maintain consistency, and vice-versa

## Structure of a Visual Identity

Upon delivery, a Visual Identity package will include:

* Colors

Relevant to the company, their codes, and optionally, why they are being used

* Logo

If it is a color logo, it should also include a black and white version.

Depending on the client, there may be several use cases in which the logo must be adapted to, such as both a full-black and full-white version.

* Typography

Including the font names, licences(if required) and any established rules relevant to it, such as the kerning.

Examples of all Typography should be provided.

* Identity Guidelines

This will be Guidelines ap pertaining to the Visual Identity which conform to any agreed upon Brand/Company identity guidelines.

* Extras

Depending on the client, they may want branded accessories where the basic logo is not desirable, and so request extras as part of the package.

For example, the client may have "Team shorts" that have the company's name down the side of the leg, but the Typography doesn't lend itself well to this particular application on clothing, so a special branded Typography may be requested.

Another example of this is the difference between all of McDonald's corporate branding, and the McCafe branding that was created specifically for their coffee service section, which deviates from the rest of the company's familiar branding, but works very well.

## Creating a Logo Concept: The 7 types of Logos

Even though all logos, no matter the type, are a combination of images and strong typography, each type of logo has its own flavor and uniqueness. While each logo is different in its own way, there are seven main categories:

1. Emblems

An emblem is a logo that features text, a symbol, or imagery all inside of one geometric shape.

Some examples: Starbucks, Harley Davidson

2. Pictorial marks (or logo symbols)

A logo reduced to its symbolistic meaning is called a pictorial mark or a brandmark.

Some examples of brandmark logos are Apple, Twitter, Nike, Target, and McDonaldâ€™s.

3. Wordmarks (or logotypes)

The main feature of the logotype design is it's typography made up of the company's name.

You won't find symbols, graphic patterns, or emblems in a logotype.

For example: "Coca-Cola", or "Walt Disney"

4. Monogram logos (or lettermarks)

A reduction of the brand's name to an acronym, lettermarks, or letterform

Often used when a company has two or more names, allowing the company to be expressed with a couple of letters instead of longer words

For example: "HBO" and "CNN"

5. Abstract logo marks

Instead of being a recognizable image - like an apple or a bird - as the name suggests, the abstract logo design does not include recognizable images but abstract geometric forms and abstract elements.

Ideally these should represent a business, such as Microsoft's logo being a 'window'

Other non-representative examples: The Olympic Rings, or the "Triangle, Circle, Square" of ABC broadcasting

6. Mascot logos

Mascot logos are often used for sports teams, beverage companies, and food brands.

Lexus is probably not in the market for a talking Zebra, but your local shake shack just might be!

7. Combination marks

The combination mark logo is a combo mark of various kinds of logo designs.

The best thing about this type of dynamic mark is that you can mix multiple types of logo design if you cannot decide on a single image, symbol, or abstract form.

For Example: Pizza Hut(Hat, words, swoosh), Puma (Words with a jumping cat), PBS (circle with a head inside of it, with the letters PBS coming after), NBC (The peacock symbol placed above the letters)

> **Favicons** are icons(for short-cuts) which are distilled and simplified versions of company logos. These are primarily used on websites,social media, and apps

## Creating a Logo Concept: Brainstorming and Drafting

* Begin by sketching up concepts that are relevant and unique to the company

* Make a list of things that should also be associated with the company for inspiration (e.g. Hammers, Nails, Hard-hats = Construction Company staples)

This is where both the professional know-how and the artistic licence make their first appearances.

Using the color palette for inspiration; not just the colors but the meanings behind why they were selected, along with other things that are strongly associated with the company as inspiration; It's time to just start throwing things on to the wall by feel, and then keep what sticks.

Eventually you will have short listed several concepts that you can run by the client.

It's not uncommon for this to be a lengthy process, as the identity of the company is tied to the logo, often in a make or break fashion, so it's not uncommon for this to be comparatively expensive, and take a good amount of time (Brainstorming over the course of 1 or even 2 weeks is not uncommon).

This is tailored Art as well as concept, and you can only expect to get out what you put in.

There is no point on a rush job for anyone who takes their business seriously, nor should you take a client seriously who is asking for one, as this is definitely a *Red Flag*(Unless the concept was provided for you in detail), so if you do, **Get the payment up-front**.
